We collaborate as a team of two persons, Merlin and Yi.
Together, we begin by reading and discussing the paper, then drafting each part.
We next move on to the practical part:
Merlin is in charge of creating the HTML page framework and the polyhedron transformation.
Yi is responsible for creating different illustrations required to explain the theoretical part and for creating a summary of the analysis of the theoretical section.
